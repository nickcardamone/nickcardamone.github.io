In 2022, I co-authored a manuscript with faculty from the Perelamn School of Medicine (Drs. Rebecca Stewart, James McKay, Emily Becker-Haimes) and two hard-working undergraduate research assistants (Allison Schachter and Chloe Becker).

TLDR: There are a lot of measures out there for substance use disorder assessment and treatment planning. We provide a guide to the lowest hanging fruit (the free, brief, and Internet accessible) so that clinicians and counselors can readily implement them in their practice.
