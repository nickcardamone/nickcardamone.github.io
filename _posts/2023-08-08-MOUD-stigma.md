In 2022, I co-authored a manuscript with faculty from the Perelamn School of Medicine (Drs. Rebecca Stewart, David Mandell, Steven Marcus, Kyle Kampman, Christoper Tjoa), the University of Kentucky School of Medicine (Dr. Hannah Knudsen), and the preceding research coordinator for the study (Nayoung Kwon) on stigma toward medications for opioid use disorder.

TLDR: Leaders of organizations that did not frequently treat their opioid use disorder patients with buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone, were more likely to endorse stigmatizing barriers as a reason for not implementing these medications (relative to leaders of high adopting agencies). 
That is, they were more likely to rate barriers like, "buprenorphine is like substituting one drug for another" as an inhibitor to implementation.TLDR: Leaders of organizations that did not frequently treat their opioid use disorder patients with buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone, were more likely to endorse stigmatizing barriers as a reason for not implementing these medications (relative to leaders of high adopting agencies).
